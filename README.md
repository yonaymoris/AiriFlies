Airi Flies is an interactive game played using your voice.
Airi Flies is an interactive game played using your voice. 
To start the game say PLAY. Say PEW to make Airi fly. If you lose more than 8 points or hit an obstacle, you lose. 

This project was created to encourage people to get out of their comfort zone and feel more confident about themselves regardless of what they do and what they look or sound like. 

P.S. Works for Google Chrome and Firefox.

# How It Works

The sound-classification model was trained using teachable machine 2 on 120 samples of 9 different female and male voices in addition to 84 samples of background noise. The model then is used with p5.js to create visual elements, that change their positions and appearances whenever the classes PLAY or PEW are detected. 

# Visuals

The main character of the game is a fluffy flying ball named Airi. The name was created by combining two words ai and tori from Japanese, which mean love and bird respectively. The love bird does not stand for love for someone else but rather love for yourself. Airi can also develop the higher she flies and overcomes obstacles.
